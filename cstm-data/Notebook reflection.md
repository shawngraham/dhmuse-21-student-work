# What is this notebook about? 

My Jupyter notebook demonstrates visualizations of data. 
The user begins the notebook by loading up the .csv data from Ingenium and organizing the data. 
The user then runs the provided code to create two visualizations. 
The first graph is a scatter plot based on numerical data. 
The second one is a time-series histogram that represents manufacturing over time. Both include interactive components in the graphs. 
I used HoverTool to accomplish this. 

The code is simple and so the user is free to experiment by changing variables to create their own visualizations. 

# Why does it matter?

Historians have made efforts to change the way that people engage with history.
In an effort to make history more accessible than ever, museums have been launching digital storytelling projects. 
Interactivity is fundamental to this new method of engagement. 
The interactivity enabled by these visualizations is periphery, meaning that it does not impact the direction of the narrative. [^1]  
This notebook allows users to explore the data on their own terms, and to delve deeper into what captures their attention. 
There will be variations in the conclusions that people draw from the data based on how they choose to explore the visualizations. 
The next step for this notebook to reach the ‘second level of interaction’ would be to add hyperlinks into the HoverTool bubble so that people can access further materials according to their interests. [^2] 

Working with large volumes of raw data is a common challenge in the digital history field. 
It requires historians to refine the data and present it in an effective way. [^3] 
Visualizations are an essential tool in the digital historian’s arsenal to organize their research and present their ideas. 
The Ingenium collection has thousands of rows of data. 
By visualizing certain columns, this raw data is processed into an easy-to-digest form. 

Using time-series graphs is an ideal way to visualize historical trends that emerge over time. 
Concepts like growth and change can be hard to grasp without visual props. Representing numerical data is important as well. 
Scatter plots are a great way of presenting commonalities in the data as well as outliers, lending more meaning to the data.
