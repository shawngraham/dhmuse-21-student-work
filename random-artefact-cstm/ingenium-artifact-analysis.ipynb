    "# Random Objects and Hidden Hierarchies\n",

    "## Analyzing the Ingenium Collection \n",
    "In this notebook we will explore questions about the context of artifacts and what this means for digitizing collections.  Our central purpose is to create a random artifact generator using data from the Ingenium collection, and subsequently using the same data set used for this to visualize the most common categories of technology and how they are distributed within the collection.  We will be looking at how these categories reflect the museums in the Ingenium network and what this could mean in terms of categorical representation regarding what is priroitized within the imagined hierarchy the collections produce.  We want our random artifact generator to give people a chance to find new objects that they otherwise would not have known to search for, as well as encouraging them to consider how the collection is curated, allowing them to make new connections amoungst these artifacts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "As previously stated, the data we are using is from the Ingenium collection.  When thinking about this data, we ask questions about where the data came from and its relevance in the museum.  Assuming this represents most, if not all, of the artifacts in the Ingenium collection, we know that it was collected by Ingenium \"to represent the products and processes of all areas of science and technology\" [^1].  This data is meant to represent all areas of technology, but we must assume this is a Western definition of technology, which could mean some areas are left out or could be misclassified.  This brings us to a drawback of our data, as we were not able to use any entries that did not have an image due to the nature of our notebook.  Certain artifacts have been left out of our notebook due to this fact, and this means that those using our notebook will not be presented anything that is not visually represented within the digital collections.  We are also assuming that these entries have all the informaiton given to Ingenium, even when it looks like the table is missing data.  We will be using all the information given to us from the data, but it is important to note that, like with much of the digitized data available online, we may not have it all. \n",

    "## Conclusion \n",
    "The purpose of this notebook was to generate random artifacts from the Ingenium collection in order to allow the user to find new artifacts or think about previously-seen ones in a new way.  In thinking about this, it is important to note that we had to exclude almost half of the artifacts in the collection, as they do not have images. A patron might question why so much was excluded, and what was excluded from the collection.  If we had kept all of the artifacts, perhaps the information in our graphs could have been drastically different and told a completely different story.  We wanted to be able to showcase the variety of artifacts that the Ingenium collection contains, yet also help users understand there are more ways to think about these pieces than just how they are displayed in exhibits.   \n",
    "\n",
    "To extend our notebook, we could look at what artifacts are missing images and how that could reflect the imlied hierarchy of artifacts.  Perhaps there is an entire category that has not been digitized yet, or another way hierarchy is able to be seen from the data we do have.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also continue to organize by each column to see how Ingenium further classified their artifacts, and if the labels given reflect anything.  This would help us understand how certain artifacts are labeled, and consider if there may be a better way to do this that would better reflect what is being archived. \n",
    "\n",
    "Users may also want to compare the Ingenium data with other GLAM institutions that relate to science and technology to observe any differences in how they digitize their material.  Perhaps Ingenium does not have the resources that others museums have to digitize certain artifacts, or vice versa.  Nonetheless, the comparisons that could be made with any aspect of this data can help us see what should focus on in further digitization efforts.  If there are entire categories that cannot be digitized, we should be wondering why and what could be done instead to preserve them in an accessible format.  Does this mean only artifacts that can be digitized can be preserved, or is there other ways of preserving them that we have not discovered yet?  \n",
