    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook takes the Theatre History of Operations [(THOR) World War Two data](https://data.world/datamil/world-war-ii-thor-data/workspace/file?filename=THOR_WWII_DATA_CLEAN.csv) and visualizes it based on the top six aircraft that appear in the dataset. The goal for this notebook is to examine how certain WW2 aircraft were used by Allied air forces. We will use Pandas and Bokeh to sort and visualize a dataset. Filtering will help make the data easier to navagate, and visualizing the data will also make it easier to understand. We will also explore subsets of data and missing data gague the accuracy of our visualizations. Hopefully this makes the data more accessible, and the same methods can be used to explore other aspects of the dataset, helping to inspire further research and investigation.\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "The data we will use for the the notebook is THOR Data, which is a database of historical aerial bombings from World War One to Vietnam. The dataset we will be using combines digitized paper mission reports from World War Two, from 1939 to 1945. [Here](https://data.world/datamil/world-war-ii-thor-data) is a link to the full dataset, with a description and summary. \n",
    "<br><br>The dataset we will be using was reduced by Charlie Harper in his tutorial, [Vidualizing Data with Bokah and Pandas](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/visualizing-with-bokeh#the-wwii-thor-dataset). The CSV file has been reduced to 19 columns from the original 62. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Our data is limited because it only includes 19 out of the total 62 columns of data. However, this also allows us to narrow down our analysis to bombing data and core mission information. The dataset also sorts aircraft model information by type, which claims to be [\"more robust than previous studies\"](https://data.world/datamil/thor-data-dictionary/workspace/file?filename=THOR+Draft+Data+Dictionary+Dec+2016.pdf). For this reason, it is a relatively thorough record of the types of airplanes that were used by Allied forces in aerial bombings throughout the war (from Sept 3, 1939 to May 1945). However, the dataset contains more information about missions in the European theatre and is [less thorough on RAF boming in the Mediterranea, African, and Pacific theatres](https://data.world/datamil/thor-data-dictionary/workspace/file?filename=THOR+Draft+Data+Dictionary+Dec+2016.pdf). The data was also [compiled by an American team working with the Pentagon](https://insight.livestories.com/s/v2/thor-overview/a100cd16-c2a7-453b-8ea6-45947c1bbc51), so the data is skewed heavily with American sources. We will further investigate the limitations of the data for our purposes by calculating missing data from each column. \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "Overall, we have been able to explore and visualize our THOR WW2 data. Using Pandas, we have sorted the data by mission country and aircraft name. We were able to determine how many times each type of aircraft appeared in the dataset. With this information, we were able to visualize the top six types of aircraft present in the dataset using Bokeh. Bokeh's interactive features allowed us to compare the aircraft, how often each were used, and the types of munitions that each aircraft dropped. We can see that most aircraft were used to deploy high explosive munitions, and aircrafts B17 and B24 were most used overall, regardless of munition type. Finally, we were also able to examine how much of the data was missing from our dataset, giving us insight as to what kind of information was deemed important enough to record. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Further research could examine Canada's own contribution to WW2 aerial missions by crossreferencing with other data. For example, I considered creating a time-series chart with the [Ingenium data](https://ingeniumcanada.org/collection-research/artifact-open-data-set-mash-up), filtering for aircraft parts manufactured between 1939 to 1945. Since the data has robust information on the target countries of each mission, the same filtering and visualizations used in this notebook could be used to examine types of munitions used on target countries. Aircraft type by mission country could also be examined. Interesting results might also be yielded by exploring the least-used aircraft. Linking this data with other archival data, such as war diaries or photography catalogues, could also help to contextualize the categorical and quantitative data that we have worked with today, shifting focus to a more subjective and relationship-based exploration. \n",

    "This article discusses more informtion about how the THOR data was developped. It has notes on how the data can be used as an archive, for personal exploration, and for more applied purposes, like investigating unexploded ordnance. This article is very insightful as a starting point to be more informed on the scope of the data.\n",

    "This article does a great job exploring the subjectivity of data. Recording, cleaning, and exploring data is always an ongoing process that is profoundly shaped by human action. The dataset itself can be an object of study -- what does it say about the institution or the culture that produced it?\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "Since the THOR data is just raw information that is not presented in any particularly accessible way, this article presents and example of how archival materials can be made more accessible. The article breaks down an interactive website that allows users to explore the archive through many different points of entry that accommodate for different interests. This method also allows users to discover and explore further than what they may have intitally been looking for. The emphasis on linking data and sharing assets also applies to the THOR data, which can be used as a jumping off point for further investigation."
